# About NoPaper

NoPaper is a bridge between rigorous academic research and decentralized technology. We are a non-profit community dedicated to digitizing sustainability and rewarding real-world impact.

## The Team

The team behind NoPaper chooses to remain anonymous, prioritizing privacy and the progress of the protocol over individual recognition. We believe that in a decentralized ecosystem, the results and the integrity of the code matter more than the identities of the contributors. Our collective efforts are focused on building a secure, transparent, and fair network for all users.

## Research as a Foundation

NoPaper is not a simple application; it is the culmination of extensive, multi-year research into sustainable digital ecosystems. Our methodologies and impact data are academically grounded and open for global scrutiny.

We are proud to be accredited by **Zenodo** for our research contributions.
