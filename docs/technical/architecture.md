# How NoPaper Works

NoPaper is a bridge between your eco-friendly actions and the blockchain. Our system is designed to be fast, secure, and user-friendly.

## System Overview

The NoPaper ecosystem consists of three main parts:

1. **The App (Frontend)**: Your interface for connecting your wallet and uploading digital receipts.
2. **The Brain (Backend & AI)**: Uses advanced AI (GPT-4o) to instantly verify your receipts and run security checks.
3. **The Ledger (Blockchain)**: The VeChainThor blockchain, where rewards are sent and impact is recorded forever.

## Our Technology

We use world-class technologies to ensure a seamless experience:

- **AI Verification**: We use state-of-the-art computer vision to analyze your grocery receipts and identify sustainable purchases.
- **Secure Storage**: Your original receipt data is stored in encrypted, private storage, while only a blurred version is used for public blockchain proof.
- **Blockchain Infrastructure**: Built on the energy-efficient VeChainThor network, ensuring your rewards are decentralized and verifiable.

## The Submission Journey

1. **Capture**: You take a screenshot of your digital receipt.
2. **Analyze**: Our AI scans the receipt for organic products, eco-friendly certifications, and local produce.
3. **Verify**: Security checks ensure you are a genuine user on a genuine device.
4. **Reward**: The smart contract automatically sends B3TR tokens to your VeWorld wallet.
5. **Impact**: Your contribution to a greener planet is recorded on your profile.

## Security Partners

To keep the platform fair, we integrate with industry leaders for:
- **Geolocation**: Ensuring users are not using VPNs or fake locations.
- **Wallet Trust**: Verifying the age and history of wallets to prevent bot farming.
- **VeBetterDAO**: Collaborating with the wider VeChain ecosystem for sustainable governance.
