# How NoPaper Works

NoPaper is a bridge between your eco-friendly actions and the blockchain. Our system is designed to be fast, secure, and user-friendly, utilizing high-performance asynchronous processing.

## System Overview

The NoPaper ecosystem consists of four main parts:

1. **The App (Frontend)**: A modern interface for connecting your wallet and uploading digital receipts.
2. **The High-Performance Queue**: A robust background worker system that handles computational tasks in parallel.
3. **The AI Engine (Backend)**: Uses Combined AI (GPT-5.2 + Claude Opus 4.5) and custom security algorithms to verify receipts and run fraud checks.
4. **The Ledger (Blockchain)**: The VeChainThor blockchain, where rewards are registered and impact is recorded permanently.

## Our Technology Stack

We use state-of-the-art technologies to ensure a premium, lag-free experience:

- **Asynchronous Processing**: We offload heavy tasks (like AI validation and blockchain transactions) to background workers. This allows users to receive instant confirmation while the "Brain" works in the background.
- **AI-Vision Verification**: We use advanced computer vision to analyze grocery receipts and accurately identify sustainable purchases.
- **Dual-Layer Proof**: Your original receipt data is stored in encrypted, private storage, while a cryptographically blinded version is used for public blockchain proof.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Built on the energy-efficient VeChainThor network, with a Redis-backed queuing system for enterprise-grade reliability.

## The Submission Journey

1. **Capture & Upload**: You share a digital receipt. The app instantly acknowledges it and adds it to your history with a **"Validating"** status.
2. **Fast-Queue Security**: High-priority background workers run instant checks for device integrity and network quality.
3. **Deep AI Scan**: Our AI engine analyzes the content for eco-friendly products and calculates your sustainability score.
4. **On-Chain Settlement**: Once approved, our workers securely register the transaction on the VeChain blockchain.
5. **Real-Time Reward**: Your earned B3TR tokens arrive in your wallet, and your impact history is updated in real-time.

## Ecosystem Integrity

To keep the platform fair, we integrate with industry-leading security practices:
- **VeBetterDAO Governance**: Aligning with ecosystem standards for sustainability and transparency.
- **Hardware Binding**: Using unique device signatures to prevent sybil attacks.
- **Community Moderation**: VIP Endorsers provide a human layer of trust for complex validation cases.
