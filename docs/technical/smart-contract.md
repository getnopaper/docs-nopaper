# Smart Contract

The NoPaper smart contract is the backbone of our reward system on the VeChainThor blockchain. It ensures that rewards are distributed fairly, transparently, and securely.

## What the Contract Does

Our smart contract manages four key areas:

### 1. Reward Distribution
When our AI verifies a submission, it triggers the smart contract to instantly send B3TR tokens to your wallet. This process is fully automated and recorded on the blockchain.

### 2. Reward Cycles
Rewards are managed in weekly cycles. Each cycle has a specific amount of B3TR tokens allocated for users. Once a cycle ends, a new one begins with a fresh allocation.

### 3. Sustainability Proofs
Every time a reward is sent, the contract records "proof" of the action. This includes:
- **Impact Category**: (e.g., Carbon reduction, Plastic saved)
- **Impact Value**: The quantified environmental benefit.
- **Verification Proof**: A reference to the verified digital receipt.

### 4. Security & Blacklisting
To protect the ecosystem, the contract includes a security layer that allows administrators to blacklist wallets that are found to be cheating or farming rewards. Blacklisted wallets cannot receive any further rewards.

## Integration with VeBetterDAO

NoPaper is fully integrated with the **VeBetterDAO** ecosystem. We use the official `X2EarnRewardsPool` to distribute rewards, ensuring that every B3TR token you earn comes from a verified and sustainable source.

## Transparency

Because everything happens on the VeChainThor blockchain, you can verify every transaction, reward, and sustainability claim using a public explorer like [VeChain Explorer](https://explore.vechain.org).

::: info Network Support
NoPaper operates on both the VeChain Testnet (for development) and Mainnet (for real-world impact).
