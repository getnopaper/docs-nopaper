# Security & Trust

NoPaper is built on a foundation of fairness and security. We implement multiple layers of protection to ensure that rewards go to genuine users who are making a real impact.

## Our Security Layers

Before a reward is sent, every submission passes through seven levels of security:

1.  **Rate Limiting**: We limit submissions to 2 every 20 hours to prevent spam and ensure everyone gets a fair share of the reward pool.
2.  **Device & Network Check**: We enforce a **strict 1 Smartphone + 1 IP Address** rule. Using multiple wallets or devices to "farm" rewards is strictly prohibited.
3.  **VPN Detection**: To ensure genuine community growth, we block all VPNs, proxies, and data center connections.
4.  **Image Fingerprinting**: Our AI detects if an image has been submitted before, or if it has been modified to look like a new receipt.
5.  **AI Content Analysis**: We verify that the receipt is a digital screenshot and contains valid sustainable items.
6.  **VIP Moderation (Endorsers)**: High-trust community leaders who manually verify suspicious or new-born wallet submissions.
7.  **AI Validation**: Final content analysis for verified sustainable items.

## Zero-Tolerance Device & Network Policy

- **No Multiple Wallets**: Using more than one wallet address to "farm" or bypass limits is strictly forbidden.
- **One Device per Person**: Each user must use their own unique smartphone.
- **Stable Connection**: Please use a stable home or mobile network. Switching between networks frequently may be flagged as suspicious.

::: danger Immediate Ban

## Ban Appeal Process

If your wallet has been flagged or banned due to "Multiple IP Address" suspicion or other security reasons, don't worry we are here to help.

### Suspicious IP/Multiple Account Bans
Sometimes, legitimate users using public WiFi or dynamic IPs might get flagged. 
- **Appeal in App**: You can use our dedicated **Appeal System** directly within the NoPaper application.
- **How it works**: If your account is flagged, a prompt will appear on your dashboard. Simply provide an explanation for the activity.
- **Manual Review**: Our **VIP Endorsers** will manually review your history and the reason provided to restore access if you are a genuine user.

::: tip Fast Recovery
The in-app appeal system is the fastest way to restore access. Most appeals are reviewed by our community endorsers within 24-48 hours.

## Protecting Your Privacy

We take your privacy seriously:
- **Receipt Images**: Your original receipts are stored in a private, encrypted vault. They are never shared publicly.
- **On-Chain Proof**: Only a blurred, unreadable version of your receipt is recorded on-chain to prove the transaction happened without exposing your shopping habits.
- **Data Retention**: IP records used for security are only kept for 24 hours.

## Smart Contract Security

The ultimate security layer is the blockchain. Our smart contracts are built using industry-standard security patterns and are governed by the VeBetterDAO ecosystem, ensuring your rewards are always safe and verifiable.
