# Ecosystem Multipliers

Boost your NoPaper rewards by participating in the VeBetterDAO ecosystem and holding VOT3 tokens.

## Multiplier Tiers

Voting for NoPaper in allocation rounds is **entirely optional**. There is no difference in rewards between users who vote for NoPaper and those who do not. The multiplier is based solely on your VOT3 status within the ecosystem.

| Tier | VOT3 Required | Bonus Multiplier |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| None | < 2,500 | 1x |
| Bronze | ≥ 2,500 | **3x** |
| Silver | ≥ 7,500 | **5x** |
| Gold | ≥ 15,000 | **8x** |

## How It Works

### Step 1: Check Your VOT3 Balance

Your VOT3 balance includes liquid VOT3 in your wallet and delegated VOT3 from VeDelegate accounts. 

### Step 2: Ecosystem Participation (Optional)

You can participate in VeBetterDAO governance at [governance.vebetterdao.org](https://governance.vebetterdao.org). While we appreciate community support, voting for NoPaper is optional and does not provide an advantage or change your reward multiplier.

### What is VOT3?
VOT3 is VeBetterDAO's governance token that gives you voting power and ecosystem multipliers.

### Step 3: Submit Your Receipt

When you submit, NoPaper checks your total VOT3 (wallet + VeDelegate) and applies the corresponding multiplier to your base reward.

## Example Calculations

### Bronze Tier
- Base Reward: 0.5 B3TR
- Multiplier: 3x
- **Final: 1.5 B3TR**

### Gold Tier
- Base Reward: 2.0 B3TR
- Multiplier: 8x
- **Final: 16 B3TR**

## Maximum Reward Cap

To ensure fair distribution, rewards are capped at **10 B3TR** per submission.


When you submit, you'll see:
- Your current ecosystem tier (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- The multiplier applied to your reward

## How to Get More VOT3

1. **Hold B3TR**: Stake in the ecosystem
2. **VeDelegate**: Delegate to active governance participants
3. **Ecosystem Activities**: Participate in VeBetterDAO events
