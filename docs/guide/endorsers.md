# NoPaper Endorsers (VIP)

NoPaper Endorsers are high-trust community leaders and Node Holders who form our manual moderation layer. They play a critical role in ensuring the integrity of the NoPaper ecosystem by verifying submissions that require a human touch.

## The Role of an Endorser

While our AI handles the majority of submissions, Endorsers focus on maintaining a high quality of verification. They are empowered with the authority to:
- **Approve/Reject**: Manually verify submissions from new or suspicious wallets.
- **Flag & Signal**: Identify professional farmers or fraudulent patterns.
- **Appeal Response**: Review and respond to user [appeals](/guide/appeals) regarding banned wallet addresses.

### 30% Allocation
To honor their commitment and responsibility, **30% of the total weekly B3TR allocation** is dedicated to the Endorser pool. These high-trust individuals are the backbone of our community-led security.

## How It Works: The 4-Hour Rule

Timing is everything. To ensure users aren't left waiting:
1. When a submission from a "Newborn" wallet is flagged for inspection, it is sent to our Endorser queue.
2. Endorsers have a **4-hour window** to take action.
3. If no action is taken within 4 hours, the system automatically redirects the submission to our AI for verification to maintain a smooth user experience.

## Security & Ethics

Being a VIP Endorser comes with significant responsibility. We have implemented strict security measures to prevent abuse:

- **Anonymous by Design**: To protect the privacy of our endorsers and maintain neutrality, only wallet addresses are shown. We discourage endorsers from publicly disclosing their status.
- **No Self-Approval**: Endorsers are strictly prohibited from approving their own submissions. Our system automatically detects and blocks any attempt to do so.
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Our "Anti-Fraud Layer" monitors endorser activity using:
    - **Geolocation tracking**
    - **Strict IP address monitoring**
    - **VPN & Proxy detection**
    - **Session behavior analysis**

## Focus: Protecting the Network

Our trust model is simple:
- **Established Wallets**: Long-term VeChain users with a proven history are trusted by the system.
- **Newborn Wallets**: New wallets are the primary focus of Endorser inspection to prevent Sybil attacks and farming.
