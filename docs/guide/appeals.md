# Ban Appeals & Trust Recovery

At NoPaper, we prioritize network integrity through a strict "Anti-Fraud Layer". However, we understand that legitimate users can sometimes be flagged due to technical glitches or unusual activity (like switching between WiFi and Mobile Data).

If your account has been flagged, you can now use our **In-App Appeal System** to restore your access.

## The Appeal Process

NoPaper provides a transparent, human-reviewed appeal process to ensure every user is treated fairly.

### 1. Submitting an Appeal
When you are blocked from submitting, a prompt will appear on your dashboard.
- **Provide a Reason**: Explain why your activity might have looked suspicious (e.g., "I shared a hotspot with my colleague" or "I am traveling and using a public VPN").
- **Submit**: Your request is sent directly to our **VIP Endorsers** for review.

### 2. VIP Endorser Review
Your appeal is not handled by AI, but by our high-trust **Endorser Team**. 
- They review your submission history and account age.
- They check the reason provided in your appeal.
- **Privacy First**: Endorsers only see your wallet address and your explanation. Your identity remains private.

### 3. Resolution
Once an Endorser or Admin reviews your appeal:
- **Approved (Vouched)**: Your account is immediately unbanned, and your fraud records are cleared. You can resume earning B3TR rewards.
- **Rejected**: If the activity is clearly fraudulent (e.g., blatant farming), the appeal will be rejected, and the block remains permanent.

## For VIP Endorsers

VIP Endorsers are the guardians of the NoPaper ecosystem. They have the power to "Vouch" for a user.

### Endorser Rights & Privileges
- **Dashboard Access**: Endorsers have a dedicated workspace to view pending appeals.
- **Justice at One Click**: By clicking "Approve", the Endorser clears the user's IP/Wallet flags and unblocks their smart contract access.
- **Multiplier Rewards**: Endorsers receive a portion of the weekly B3TR allocation for their active participation in keeping the network clean.

### The "Double-Seal" Security
For maximum safety:
1. **VIP Vouching**: A VIP Endorser can "Vouch" for a user (Status: *Vouched*).
2. **Admin Finality**: The NoPaper Admin performs the final unban operation based on the Endorser's recommendation.

## FAQ

#### How long does an appeal take?
Appeals are usually reviewed within **24-48 hours** by our volunteer endorser team.

#### Can I appeal multiple times?
You can submit a new appeal if your situation changes, but we encourage providing as much detail as possible in your first attempt.

#### What happens if I am unbanned but misbehave again?
The unban clears your *past* records. If you engage in suspicious activity again (like farming with multiple wallets on the same network), the system will flag and block you again automatically.
