### 3. AI Analysis

Our GPT-4o powered AI analyzes your receipt:

- Approved: Identifies sustainable items (organic, local, eco-certified)

::: info Validity Threshold
A score of **0.5 or higher** is required for approval.

### 4. Reward Calculation

If approved, your reward is calculated based on:

1. **Wallet Trust Level**: Older wallets get higher rewards
2. **Receipt Value**: Larger eco-purchases = more reward
3. **Ecosystem Multipliers**: Bonus for ecosystem participants

### 5. Blockchain Registration

The reward is registered on-chain via our NoPaper smart contract:
- Transaction sent to VeChainThor blockchain
- B3TR tokens transferred to your wallet
- Submission recorded permanently
