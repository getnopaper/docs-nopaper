# NoPaper Referral Program 🍃

Expand the sustainability movement and earn rewards together with your friends! The NoPaper Referral Program allows you to earn B3TR tokens by inviting others to digitize their sustainable actions.

## 🚀 How to Participate

1. **Get Your Code**: Open the **Referral Center** in your NoPaper app.
2. **Personalize**: (Optional) Customize your referral code to make it easier to remember (e.g., `ecowarrior1`).
3. **Share**: Copy your unique referral link and send it to your friends via social media, chat, or QR code.
4. **Link Accounts**: Ensure your friend uses your link to join or enters your code manually in the **Redeem** tab.

## 📜 Program Rules

- **Referral Reward**: You will receive **5 B3TR** for every friend who successfully joins and becomes active.
- **Eligibility**: A referred friend is considered active once they have at least **2 Approved Submissions**.
- **Earnings Cap**: To maintain ecosystem health, your total referral earnings are capped at **2.0x your lifetime earnings** from your own eco-actions.
- **New & Existing Users**: Both new users and existing NoPaper users who haven't been referred yet can link to a referrer.

## 💸 Payout Schedule

- **Bi-Weekly Processing**: Referral rewards are processed in **bi-weekly batches** (twice a month).
- **Batch Settlement**: Rewards are accumulated and sent directly to your wallet once the administrative settlement is complete every two weeks.
- **Transparency**: You can track your "Paid" vs "Pending" rewards anytime in the Referral Center.

## 🗳️ Voting Policy

- **No Conflict of Interest**: Voting for NoPaper in the VeBetterDAO ecosystem is a community governance action.
- **Fair Earning**: **Voting for NoPaper does NOT impact your earnings per submission.** Your rewards are strictly determined by the validity and impact of your digitized eco-actions.
- **Independence**: We encourage community participation, but your daily earning potential remains independent of your voting choices.
