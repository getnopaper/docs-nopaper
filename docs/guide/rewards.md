# B3TR Rewards

NoPaper distributes B3TR tokens from the VeBetterDAO ecosystem to reward your sustainable actions.

## What is B3TR?

B3TR is the utility token of the [VeBetterDAO](https://vebetterdao.org) ecosystem on VeChainThor blockchain. It's used to:

- 🗳️ Vote for sustainable apps
- 💱 Trade on exchanges
- 🎁 Earn through X2Earn applications like NoPaper

## How Rewards Work

### Reward Pool

NoPaper receives B3TR allocations from VeBetterDAO's reward pool each **cycle** (~1 week). These tokens are distributed to verified submissions.

### Base Reward Calculation

Your base reward depends on:

1. **Wallet Trust Level** (based on wallet age)
2. **Receipt Quality** (items purchased)
3. **Environmental Impact** (sustainability score)

```
Final Reward = Base Reward × Ecosystem Multiplier
```

### Reward Ranges by Trust Level

| Trust Level | Min Reward | Max Reward |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Newcomer (&lt;30 days) | 0.01 B3TR | 0.05 B3TR |
| Established (30-90 days) | 0.05 B3TR | 0.5 B3TR |
| Trusted (90-180 days) | 0.2 B3TR | 1.0 B3TR |
| Veteran (&gt;180 days) | 0.5 B3TR | 2.0 B3TR |
